BeatDesign is an independent, open-source, local-first workspace for AI image and video creation. It is built for people who want the connected creative flow of tools such as Higgsfield, with a workspace they can run, inspect, and extend on their own machine.

## Two creative modes, one Project

### Infinite Canvas

Drop in prompts, images, video, and audio. Connect nodes, branch ideas, compare generations, reuse outputs, and keep the full visual workflow inside one project.

### Video Editor

Turn Canvas results into a local timeline. Trim, split, move, mix audio, place and transform image overlays, style SRT captions, create alternate AI Takes, preview, and export MP4 in the browser.

Studio provides a focused generation surface. Assets keeps every imported and generated file available across Canvas, Editor, and MCP.

## Why BeatDesign

- **Local by default.** Projects, media, Canvas state, timelines, and generation history stay in your local workspace.
- **Canvas and Editor stay connected.** A generated result becomes a reusable project Asset instead of disappearing inside one tool.
- **Bring your own Agent.** Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP hosts can inspect and update the same Project you see in the browser.
- **Bring your own generation access.** BeatAPI is the built-in provider. Local importing, arranging, editing, previewing, and exporting do not require an API key.
- **Fork-friendly foundations.** Provider adapters, project storage, and the command layer are explicit extension points.

## From idea to finished video

```text
Prompt or local media
        ↓
Infinite Canvas ─── connect, generate, branch, compare
        ↓
Shared Assets ───── images, video, audio, extracted clips
        ↓
Video Editor ────── trim, arrange, preview, export MP4
        ↑
Any MCP Agent ───── works in the same local Project
```

## Quick start

Requirements include Node.js 22+, `pnpm` 10+, and a current Chrome browser on macOS or Windows.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:push
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3020](http://127.0.0.1:3020).

Add your own [BeatAPI API key](https://beatapi.io/dashboard/apikeys) only when you want to generate or analyze media, or use AI redo. Selecting a local file does not upload it to a provider.

### Choose how to run BeatDesign

| Command | Starts |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | The visual workspace |
| `pnpm dev:agent` | The visual workspace and local HTTP MCP endpoint |
| `pnpm mcp` | The stdio MCP server for coding Agents |

## Use BeatDesign with an Agent

BeatDesign exposes 29 local MCP tools for Skills, Projects, Assets, Canvas, generation, and Editor operations, including built-in Skill discovery and authoritative MP4 timeline rendering. Agent changes use the same project services and become visible in the browser workspace.

After connecting your MCP host, you can ask:

> Open my latest BeatDesign project, add these clips to a timeline, place the logo overlay, adjust the subtitles, and leave the Editor open for review.

## What works today

- Image and video generation plus Standard and Deep video analysis.
- Image, video, audio, generation, timeline, and text nodes on the Canvas.
- Project Assets shared across Studio, Canvas, Editor, and MCP.
- Non-destructive timeline editing with image, video, audio, movable image overlays, and styled SRT caption tracks.
- Local preview and browser-side H.264/AAC MP4 export with WebCodecs and Mediabunny.
- English, Chinese, and Japanese interfaces.
- Local stdio and Streamable HTTP MCP transports.

BeatDesign currently focuses on local, short-form creative workflows. Hosted collaboration, multiple named timelines, advanced transitions, speed controls, waveforms, and desktop packaging remain outside the current release.

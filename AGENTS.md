# Slate Agent Instructions

## Project Identity

This repository is **Slate**.

Slate originated from BeatDesign but is now an independent product.

> The section below ("BeatDesign agent guide") documents the inherited BeatDesign engineering context. Slate-specific directives are above it. Where the two overlap, Slate directives govern product direction; BeatDesign directives govern the inherited codebase's engineering and provider conventions.

## Before Any Significant Work

Before significant work, read at a minimum:

```text
PROJECT.md
UPSTREAM.md
docs/architecture/README.md
```

When the task touches any of:

```text
provider
command
domain
canvas
timeline
MCP
agent
generation
asset
```

and `docs/architecture/BEATDESIGN_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` exists, read it as well.

## General Engineering Rule

Priority order:

```text
Working
>
Evolvable
>
Maintainable
>
Architecturally Elegant
```

Do not perform large rewrites for `clean architecture`, `future-proofing`, or `upstream compatibility` without clear benefit.

## Preserve Proven Infrastructure

Unless a task explicitly requires it, do not proactively rewrite:

```text
media
export
asset-first lifecycle
command persistence
CAS
idempotency
conflict retry
security utilities
provider registry
```

## Slate-owned Architecture

New product capabilities should go into **Slate-owned modules**. Avoid writing Story / Shot / Character / Agent logic directly into:

```text
Canvas nodes
Timeline document
BeatAPI adapter
React components
```

## Canvas Rule

```text
Canvas is a projection / interaction surface.
Canvas is not the primary business-domain source of truth.
```

Do not keep stuffing new business fields into the Canvas card schema just because it is convenient for an Agent.

## Timeline Rule

```text
Timeline is an assembly surface.

Do not store story/domain semantics in Timeline unless strictly necessary for assembly.
```

## Provider Rule

Any new model capability must avoid leaking `provider-specific assumptions` into the general `Domain` / `Canvas` / `Timeline` / `Command` / `Asset` modules.

## Asset Rule

Generated media should become a project `Asset` before becoming a durable reference in higher-level workflows.

Keep:

```text
Generation
→ Asset
→ Domain / Canvas / Timeline
```

## Agent Mutation Rule

Long-term direction:

```text
Agent
→ Application Command / API
→ Domain / Core
→ UI projection
```

Do not introduce patterns of:

```text
Agent
→ React state mutation
```

## No Premature Drama Implementation

At the current Foundation stage, do not add, without an explicit task:

```text
Character Bible
Story Bible
Director Agent
Continuity Agent
Episode system
Shot UI
```

Follow the concrete Phase implementation plan instead.

## Upstream Awareness

Before modifying BeatDesign-inherited code:

1. Decide whether it belongs to the `invariant core` or the `diverged Slate surface`.
2. If `invariant core`: prefer extension, avoid meaningless renames, and keep the diff small.
3. If the `Slate-owned product surface`: do not sacrifice sound product architecture just to keep upstream merges comfortable.

## Naming

The product name is `Slate`. However, do **not** perform a global internal rename (`BeatDesign → Slate`, `bdesign → slate`) merely for brand consistency, unless there is a dedicated Naming Migration Task.

Existing mature internal names such as `BeatDesignCommand`, `persistBeatDesignCommand`, `bdesign_*` may continue to exist until then, to avoid diffs with no functional meaning.

## Licensing

Must preserve:

```text
LICENSE
third_party/
upstream copyright notices
```

Do not delete or overwrite BeatDesign / third-party attribution.

## Testing

When modifying core infrastructure, run the project's existing relevant checks:

```text
typecheck
unit tests
i18n checks
build
```

Exact commands come from `package.json`. Do not assume commands exist — read the scripts first.

## Scope Discipline

Each task should only solve the current Phase's problem. Do not implement a future Phase just because you noticed a future architectural issue while working.

If you notice extra issues, record them as:

```text
Follow-up
Technical Debt
ADR Candidate
```

instead of enlarging the current diff.

## Documentation

Significant architecture changes must be reflected in:

```text
PROJECT.md
UPSTREAM.md
docs/architecture/*
```

Do not let architecture decisions live only in commit messages or agent conversations.

## Stop Conditions

If a task asks for:

```text
audit
review
plan
design
```

do not automatically enter implementation.

If a task asks for:

```text
implementation
```

do not unilaterally extend into the next Phase.

# BeatDesign agent guide

BeatDesign is the independent, open-source Create workspace in the broader BeatAPI ecosystem. It is not the BeatAPI website frontend, the sibling `../BeatAPI SaaS Template`, or a copy of the SaaS product. BeatAPI is the built-in/default remote generation provider; the local workspace must remain useful without a BeatAPI account or API key.

## Source of truth

- Read `docs/PRODUCT_PLAN_AND_STATUS.md` before changing product scope or describing a capability as complete.
- Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing framework, database, provider, storage, deployment, MCP, or workspace boundaries.
- Read `docs/PROVIDERS.md` before changing models, provider bindings, uploads, polling, or upstream request mapping.
- Read `docs/DESIGN.md` before making visual or UI decisions. Follow its typography, color, spacing, component, and interaction language unless the user explicitly approves a change.
- Read `docs/RELEASE_SCOPE.md` before describing the repository as release-ready, published, deployed, or verified.
- Roadmaps and marketing material are context, not implementation proof. Current code, tests, and the completed sections of `docs/PRODUCT_PLAN_AND_STATUS.md` define shipped behavior.

## Product boundary

Preserve Home, Projects, Studio, Canvas, Editor, Assets, generation history, provider/storage configuration, and the BeatAPI image/video/analysis model catalog.

Studio, Canvas, Editor, Assets, generation history, and MCP are views or control surfaces over the same local Project, asset, generation, and history services. Do not create separate projects or backends when switching surfaces.

Local import, project organization, Canvas work, timeline editing, preview, and MP4 export must work without an API key. Only a confirmed remote generation, analysis, or AI-redo action may require the user's provider credentials and upload the required inputs.

Do not add authentication, accounts, payments, subscriptions, credits, API-key issuing, invitations, RBAC, admin, tickets, CMS, email providers, cloud-database dependencies, hosted-workspace assumptions, or unrelated generation adapters. BeatData, BeatGTM, BeatLeads, general Agent platforms, social publishing, CRM, and other future BeatAPI product lines are outside this repository.

Do not embed a proprietary general chatbot. BeatDesign must be complete without an Agent while allowing Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-capable Agents to operate the same Project.

## Core product model

- The product is asset-first: a generation creates an `Asset`; it does not own a single UI placement.
- A Canvas node references an Asset, Generation, or Timeline.
- A Timeline clip pins a concrete Asset and must not silently follow a Canvas generation's latest output.
- A Take is an alternate Asset for one clip; the original remains recoverable.
- Canvas edges describe visual organization. Generation lineage records real derivation separately.
- Generated and imported media return to project-owned local storage before they are treated as durable workspace outputs.

## Architecture rules

- Browser components call typed local API helpers; they do not import the database or receive raw provider credentials.
- UI and MCP writes share the same Command Kernel, validation, revision checks, project-asset boundary, and durable persistence path.
- MCP never writes SQLite directly and never replaces an entire Canvas or Timeline document. External Agents use incremental `canvas.apply` and `editor.apply` operations with stable IDs, revisions, and idempotency keys.
- Canvas layout snapshots are a UI persistence exception for drag, resize, and viewport state; external Agents still use semantic Canvas operations.
- Agent changes must become visible in the browser workspace and remain inspectable, reversible where supported, and verifiable. A database revision alone is not proof of a successful user-visible operation.
- Studio, Canvas, Editor, Assets, and MCP share project, task, asset, and generation services rather than duplicating business logic.
- Preview and browser-side MP4 export use browser-native WebCodecs and Mediabunny. Do not make system FFmpeg a requirement for the core localhost UI. Node-side MCP frame extraction and Timeline rendering may use `ffmpeg` from `PATH` or `BEATDESIGN_FFMPEG`; Timeline rendering also uses `ffprobe` from `PATH` or `BEATDESIGN_FFPROBE`. These tools must fail with a clear setup error when a required binary is unavailable.

## Provider and storage boundary

- BeatAPI is the built-in/default provider for remote image, video, audio, and analysis tasks. BeatDesign does not reproduce BeatAPI account, balance, billing, refund, routing, rate-limit, or API-key-issuing logic; it returns provider results and errors.
- UI and MCP use logical model IDs and capability schemas, not BeatAPI effect IDs or raw upstream fields.
- The canonical user-facing model catalog lives in `src/core/effects/effect-registry.ts`.
- Provider bindings live in `src/core/generation-providers/`; BeatAPI request mapping lives in `src/core/adapters/beatapi-adapter.ts`.
- Forks may add a provider through the source-level provider/adapter extension points without changing Canvas, Editor, Assets, MCP requests, or the asset-first contract. Do not add a second database-backed model registry.
- Provider keys stay server-side. Provider and optional R2/S3-compatible storage credentials stay encrypted in local SQLite.
- File selection stays local. Upload is allowed only after generation precheck and only for inputs required by that confirmed request. BeatAPI Files is the default upload path; users may configure their own public R2/S3-compatible bucket.
- Never commit API keys, provider credentials, shared storage credentials, generated user media, or local SQLite data.

## Stack and repository conventions

- TanStack Start, React 19, and TypeScript.
- TanStack Query for shared browser server-state.
- Tailwind CSS 4 and Base UI/shadcn primitives.
- Drizzle ORM with local SQLite.
- Paraglide for English and Chinese.
- Add user-facing message keys to both `messages/en.json` and `messages/zh.json`.
- Do not edit `src/routeTree.gen.ts` manually.
- Preserve unrelated user changes in a dirty worktree.

## Local promotion workspace

- `/promotion-kit/` is a local-only, Git-ignored workspace for reusable product copy, screenshots, editable visual templates, and verified promotion scripts. It is not a product source of truth and may be absent in a fresh clone.
- Keep channel submission, review, publication, ranking, and outreach status outside this repository. The promotion kit stores reusable materials, not campaign operations.
- Use English as the default locale for reusable product screenshots. Create Chinese or Japanese variants only for a specific localized deliverable.
- Before reusing marketing copy or visuals, reconcile versioned claims against `docs/PRODUCT_PLAN_AND_STATUS.md`, the current README, and current code. Never treat an older campaign file or image label as proof of current behavior.
- Promotional screenshots must use non-sensitive demo media and must not expose provider keys, cookies, tokens, personal data, private filenames, task IDs, or request IDs. Record the app version, commit, locale, capture date, and verification notes in the local promotion-kit index.
- Follow `docs/DESIGN.md` and the current product UI when creating promotional visuals. Keep raw captures separate from processed exports, and do not present a concept render as a verified product screenshot.

## Verification and completion language

After code changes, run:

```text
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm i18n:check
pnpm build
```

Run focused browser and MCP checks when changing Canvas, Editor, project persistence, provider submission, or Agent-visible behavior. A release check additionally requires clean installation/schema setup, MCP handshake, and local route smoke testing as defined in `docs/RELEASE_SCOPE.md`.

Keep these states separate when reporting completion: source change, automated checks, browser validation, MCP-to-UI validation, credentialed or paid BeatAPI end-to-end validation, commit, push/merge, GitHub Release, hosted demo, and deployment. Never infer a later state from an earlier one.
